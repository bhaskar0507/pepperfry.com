About Our Project : 

Our project is a clone of a www.pepperfry.com, where we can purchase home decor and all furniture products .

Guide to Project:

In the Home page Navbar is there for navigating to all the pages . The Navigation Bar contains a Huge Drop-Down from which one can select a particular Category to purchase. 
After selecting a particular categories , it takes us to a new page where the user will be able to see lots of products and we can filter the products on the basis
of their brand, price, and manufacturing material.
After selecting a product User can see the detail information about the product  and can add it to the cart if he or she find any particular product of his or her intrest. 

There is also a Log-in functonality where user can sign up by using 10 digit mobile number,after putting mobile number we have 
to fill OTP (one time password ) for redirecting upto information page where user can fill his details , that details gonna saved 
in the local storage .
So this is basically our project. We were four members in the team and we completed the whole project in the construct week timeline.
